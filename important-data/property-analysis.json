    "advisorMessage": "Hi Ritvik, after reviewing the details, this property at 12235 Greencanyon Dr is Too Expensive based on your current financial profile and maximum budget. The estimated monthly housing payment significantly exceeds your $2,000 budget, and your debt-to-income ratio is also higher than recommended. I strongly advise revisiting your budget or exploring properties at a lower price point to ensure long-term financial comfort and stability.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "High Housing Costs vs. Budget: Your estimated monthly housing payment of $2,672.62 significantly exceeds your maximum monthly budget of $2,000. This is the primary concern. ⚠️",
      "High DTI Ratio: Your total debt-to-income ratio is 44.07%, which is above the generally accepted healthy limit of 43%. This could make loan approval challenging or lead to unfavorable terms. ⚡",
      "Low Down Payment Impact: The preferred $2,000 down payment (less than 1% of the purchase price) results in a larger loan, higher monthly P&I, and triggers mandatory Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI), adding $117.92 to your monthly costs. 💰",
      "Market Value Discrepancy: The listed price ($285,000) is slightly above the Zestimate ($275,900) but significantly below the Tax Assessed Value ($409,661). This discrepancy warrants further investigation into the property's true market value and recent sales in the area. 🏡",
      "Ample Savings for Closing: You have sufficient available savings ($50,000) to cover the total cash needed at closing ($9,125), which is a positive aspect. ✅"
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "Budget Overrun: The property is $672.62 per month over your stated maximum budget, making it financially unsustainable based on your current comfort level. ⚠️",
      "Elevated DTI: Your DTI of 44.07% is at the higher end, indicating that a significant portion of your income would go towards debt, potentially limiting financial flexibility. ⚡",
      "High Loan-to-Value (LTV): A down payment of less than 1% means a very high LTV, which generally comes with higher risk for lenders and the buyer.",
      "Potential for Property Tax Adjustments: The significant difference between the listed price and the tax-assessed value could mean your property taxes might be re-evaluated closer to the purchase price in the future, potentially increasing your monthly costs."
